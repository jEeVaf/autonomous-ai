# autonomous-ai
Autonomous AI is a Python project that automates work such as web searching, data extraction, and topic research. It is built to reduce the manual effort of gathering information on a specific topicâ€”saving time and resources.

Real-World Scenario
Imagine a small business owner who needs to quickly gather information on a new technology to decide whether to invest. Instead of manually searching multiple websites, this tool automatically searches the web, scrapes data from relevant pages, and provides a concise summary. Evidence from industry research shows that automating such repetitive tasks can reduce work hours by more than 50%, thus accelerating decision-making processes.

Key Features
Web Searching: Automatically sends HTTP requests to search engines to find articles, blogs, and news on the topic.
Data Extraction: Uses basic web scraping techniques to parse HTML and extract key information.
Topic Research: Summarizes the findings so that a user can quickly grasp the important points.
Modular Design: The tool is built to be easily expanded. New functionalities can be added with minimal changes to the core code.
How It Works
Input Topic: The user provides a topic of interest.
Web Search: The tool constructs a search query and sends a request to a search engine.
Scraping Data: It parses the returned HTML pages and extracts useful text.
Summary Generation: The script then displays or saves a summary of the most relevant information.
